Note on fonts
=============

<!--
	Style rule: one sentence per line please!
	This makes git diffs easier to read. :)

Some files in this folder were originally made with Adobe Creative Suite products on Windows machine.
Not all files will work correctly and not all fonts will appear correctly.
Try to use the SVG file where possible to preserve interoperability.

If you need the embedded fonts, consider looking at the following places:
